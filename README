This library has been deprecated and is replaced with MaidSafe-Routing, now found at https://github.com/maidsafe/MaidSafe-Routing/wiki.

This now forms part of a much larger codebase and the DHT may still be used as a stand-alone DHT. It has some dependencies which are easily met by following the build instructions for the MaidSafe super project.

We welcome developers to join us over at https://github.com/maidsafe/MaidSafe/wiki
