This library has been depricated and is replaced with MaidSafe-routing, now found at https://github.com/maidsafe/MaidSafe/wiki 
This now forms part of a much larger codebase and the DHT may still be used as a stand alone DHT (has some dependencies though which are met by the super project). 


We welcome developers to join us over at https://github.com/maidsafe/MaidSafe/wiki.

Abbreviated instructions can be found in build/<DirAppropriateToYourOS>/README
